Hi Manish,
 
Have you tried this for the url download?
 
Adding user-Agent in to headers in python urllib2 requests?
 
https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/python-on-the-web/how-to-use-urllib2-in-python/
With urllib2 you can add your own headers with urllib2.

 

The reason why you would want to do that is that some websites dislike being

browsed by programs.

 

If you are creating an application that will access other people’s web resources,

it is  courteous to include real user agent information in your requests,

so they can identify the source of the hits more easily.

 

When you create the Request object you can add your headers to a dictionary,

and use the add_header() to set the user agent value before opening the request.

# Importing the module
import urllib2
 
# Define the url
url = 'http://www.google.com/#q=my_search'
 
# Add your headers
headers = {'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla 5.10'}
 
# Create the Request. 
request = urllib2.Request(url, None, headers)
 
# Getting the response
response = urllib2.urlopen(request)
 
# Print the headers
print response.headers
